This is my extra lab project. I use the raw data "statueLeg.raw" from professor Crawfis website.
He also provide other things such as cube32.vol and so on. My program also can run on them.
My program has used freeglut, glew, glm and the libraries and include files are all in my folder.
There are some screenshots from my program.
